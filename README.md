# Combine RL with Model-based Control

This is the code with the paper: 
 'Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning and Safety Based Control for Autonomous Driving.'
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00147.pdf'.

#The basic idea here is to combine model-free learning with model-based control to improve long-term control performance.

#The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is the model-free learning framework.

#The simulation platform is TORCS.

* The combination algorithm is in gym_torcs.py.
